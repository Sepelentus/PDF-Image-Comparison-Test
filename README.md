# PDF Image Comparison Test
 This is a test for a project where its needed to compare two pdfs or images, with the objective of checking that information is the same in both.


 ## Theres a few stuff needed for it to work
 First of all, install Tesseract OCR on your machine:
 **https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki**

 Then do:
 _pip install -r requirements.txt_

 The script file uses the default PATH, in case it doesn't, change it to where it installed.
